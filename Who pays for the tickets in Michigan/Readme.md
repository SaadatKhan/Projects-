# Who pays for the tickets in Michigan

This is an assignment from Coursera. This assignment has probably updated for which I could not find the dataset used by them. 

Please run `Michigan.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view my work of predicting whether a person with given features would comply to pay the fines. 2 Models : **Random Forest Classifier** and 
**Multi Layer Perceptron** were fit to the data-set to predict the outcomes.
