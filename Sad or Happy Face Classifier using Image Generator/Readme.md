# Sad or Happy Face Classifier using Image Generator


This is a project to classify whether a person is Sad or Happy from images.

Since, this was a Coursera Assignment, the dataset was not made public. Hence you can just view my work, not run it.

#### Use `Sad or Happy.ipynb` to view the code and my achieved accuracy over 10 epochs of training.
