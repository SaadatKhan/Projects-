# Projects-
Projects I have done repo mainly includes projects small Data Science Projects I covered during my time home in the **Lockdown**. These are also some of my favourite Coursera Assignments I covered.

The description of eache of the projects are given below:
* Look Closely into the Olympics
  * Helps you to really see some unusual and unknown interesting facts about the olympic games' history to the unschooled.
* Sad or Happy Face Classifier
  * Would help you to classify whether a face **looks** happy or sad

* The Relation between GDP, Energy Supply and Citations
  * This was a project where I mainly learned to use intersection between datasets and hence this weird income. But you can have a look at it to gain some weird insights 
 
* Who pays for the tickets in Michigan
  * Is a ML model which would predict whether a given person with appropriate feature values would pay or escape the ticket fines.
